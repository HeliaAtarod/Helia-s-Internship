first with "get_eng_names_1880-2010.ipynb" I extracted english popular names for different decades.

after that Dminik gave me the extracted counts from COHA and I added two column to the end of that named "gender"(male,female,both) and "in_decade"(boolean) in "get gender and decade.ipynb"

after that I +1 each counts (obj, sub,...) and normalized them. with file "normalizing and smoothing.ipynb"

after that I used this file "(1880-2010)4plot.ipynb" to draw 4 different type of plots for each decade.


one issue: 

I use num_bins = 20 which I dont konw is a good number or not.
