       " In criticising his features it might , perhaps , be said that his eyes were placed too near his nose , and that one was rather smaller than the other ; they were of a greyish brown , but of a peculiar clearness , and when animated possessed a fire which seemed to look through and penetrate the thoughts of others , while they marked the inspirations of his own .,\n",
